## Below are two functions that are used to create a special object that
## stores a matrix and caches its inverse

## This first function creates a matrix, which in this case is a list containing a function to do the following:
## 1. set the value of the matrix
## 2. get the value of the matrix
## 3. set the value of the inverse
## 4. get the value of the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    m <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
      x <<- y
      m <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setinverse <- function(solve) m <<- solve
    getinverse <- function() m
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setinverse = setinverse,
         getinverse = getinverse)
}


## Calculates the inverse of the special "matrix" created with makeCacheMatrix, but first checks if it
## was previously calculated. If so, the calculation is returned from the cache instead of computing

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    m <- x$getinverse()
    if(!is.null(m)) {
      message("getting cached data")
      return(m)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    m <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setinverse(m)
    m
}
